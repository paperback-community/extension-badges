## Development Contributions

### Project Conventions

- **Layout:** The layout is based on the [template repository][template-repository]. Please create an issue there before making any changes to it.

- **Branching:** The project follows these [branching conventions][branching-conventions]. Ensure branches are named and managed accordingly.

- **Versioning:** The project uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver-2.0.0].

- **Commit Messages:** Ensure your commit messages are clear and descriptive.

- **Pull Requests:** Each pull request must include a detailed description of the changes and relevant links to other issues or pull requests, rather than just using the commit message as the title.

### Development and Build Process

#### Commands

Check the scripts section in the [`package.json`][package.json] file for the available commands.

#### Adding Extensions

Steps to add extensions to this repository:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone the forked repository.
3. Run `npm i` ([Node.js][node.js] and npm need to be installed).
4. Add your extension(s) into the `src` directory.
5. Ensure `npm test` passes successfully.
6. Commit an push your changes to the remote fork.
7. Make a pull request and notify an organization maintainer.

Weâ€™ll review and work on adding your extension as quickly as possible!
